Regarding O
his O
visit O
, O
Dr. O
Sogyal B-PER
Kokala I-PER
Mayiga I-PER
said O
, O

At O
the O
invitation O
of O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Central B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
we O
decided O
to O
hold O
a O
gala O
evening. O
to O
strengthen O
the O
institutions O
of O
the O
Central B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
and O
to O
continue O
the O
search O
for O
accountability O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Mali B-LOC
. O

And O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
" O
The O
power O
of O
the O
Middle O
One O
resides O
in O
the O
threefold O
cord O
" O
. O

And O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O

The O
first O
problem O
is O
that O
of O
security O
; O
as O
long O
as O
there O
is O
no O
corruption O
in O
the O
security O
sector O
, O
citizens O
will O
always O
doubt O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
international O
community O
to O
solve O
problems O
. O

The O
matter O
is O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Commander-in-Chief O
of O
the O
Armed B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
. O

The O
second O
part O
, O
political O
revolution O
, O
focuses O
on O
political O
and O
social O
changes O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
government O
. O

These O
changes O
need O
to O
be O
made O
with O
all O
accountability O
. O

Jesus B-PER
replied O
, O
" O
It O
is O
not O
for O
me O
to O
say O
" O
. O

Until O
he O
decides O
to O
cast O
you O
aside O
. O

he O
justified O
it O
. O

It O
dates O
back O
to O
the O
earliest O
manuscript O
, O
which O
was O
not O
the O
subject O
of O
discussion O
when O
it O
was O
prepared O
. O

PEMU B-ORG
promised O
that O
any O
new O
constitution O
adopted O
by O
the O
government O
would O
be O
consensual O
, O
with O
the O
participation O
of O
all O
political O
and O
civil O
society O
leaders O
. O

In O
order O
to O
move O
to O
a O
hypothesis O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
belief O
and O
disbelief O
, O
as O
in O
previous O
hypotheses O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O

According O
to O
him O
, O
politicians O
and O
members O
of O
civil O
society O
felt O
that O
at O
least O
one O
institution O
for O
conflict O
resolution O
was O
necessary O
. O

Within O
nine O
months O
the O
government O
said O
it O
could O
not O
be O
done O
, O
unless O
he O
was O
found O
guilty O
or O
acquitted O
. O

But O
they O
couldn O
't O
prove O
that O
it O
couldn O
't O
be O
done O
in O
18 O
months O
. O

I O
brought O
together O
experts O
and O
the O
former O
head O
of O
the O
SENI B-ORG
who O
used O
to O
organize O
protests O
, O
and O
put O
them O
to O
work O
to O
see O
if O
there O
could O
be O
a O
single O
agency O
to O
deal O
with O
protests O
, O
and O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
National I-ORG
Heritage I-ORG
. O

Some O
of O
our O
more O
knowledgeable O
representatives O
took O
the O
floor O
, O
presided O
over O
by O
myself O
, O
after O
a O
three-hour O
meeting O
. O

So O
, O
who O
couldn O
't O
do O
it O
for O
nine O
months O
, O

We O
got O
the O
answer O
in O
ten O
months O
. O

His O
political O
career O
was O
cut O
short O
. O

There O
will O
be O
no O
talk O
about O
whether O
or O
not O
there O
will O
be O
a O
single O
dispute O
resolution O
body O
. O

He O
said O
it O
was O
intentional O
. O

There O
will O
be O
at O
least O
one O
step O
taken O
to O
resolve O
the O
issues O
. O

The O
question O
that O
remains O
is O
how O
will O
all O
of O
this O
be O
implemented O
? O

We O
will O
prepare O
the O
conditions O
, O
and O
the O
leaders O
will O
help O
us O
to O
implement O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

With O
determination O
and O
determination O
. O

We O
will O
put O
the O
whole O
thing O
in O
motion O
in O
such O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
so O
that O
the O
necessary O
arrangements O
can O
be O
made O
. O

This O
was O
the O
birth O
of O
the O
PEMI B-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
. O

The O
next O
National O
Planning O
Conferences O
will O
be O
held O
soon O

The O
challenges O
of O
the O
DAY O
( O
the O
day O
on O
which O
all O
national O
dialogue O
takes O
place O
) O
will O
be O
their O
focus O
. O

No O
foot O
will O
slip O
from O
it O
, O
not O
even O
a O
powerful O
one O
. O

Originally O
, O
the O
Deity B-PER
was O
an O
idealized O
representation O
of O
the O
sovereign O
. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
the O
President O
's O
failure O
to O
implement O
their O
demands O
, O
suspicion O
arose O
among O
his O
constituents O
. O

He O
pointed O
this O
out O
, O
adding O
that O
from O
the O
ground O
up O
everything O
was O
ready O
for O
him O
except O
for O
the O
preparation O
of O
the O
new O
National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
. O

It O
is O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
that O
will O
be O
exercised O
by O
the O
newly O
installed O
president O
in O
the O
executive O
branch O
, O
subject O
to O
his O
executive O
powers O
. O

Today O
, O
we O
even O
have O
the O
means O
in O
the O
constitution O
to O
seek O
the O
impeachment O
or O
removal O
of O
the O
president O
of O
the O
country O
, O
who O
has O
deliberately O
betrayed O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
nation O
. O

He O
stopped O
our O
rulers O
from O
doing O
as O
they O
pleased O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
up O
to O
the O
people O
to O
make O
their O
own O
constitution O
, O
not O
the O
intellectuals O
. O

He O
squeezed O
it O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
forcefully O
. O

On O
the O
issue O
of O
human O
rights O
abuses O
, O
especially O
threats O
against O
UNITED B-ORG

first O
case O
to O

tried O
by O

shepherd O

) O
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
the O
murder O
of O
Nuhumu B-PER

She O
was O
sentenced O
to O
life O
imprisonment O
after O
being O
found O
not O

of O
the O
charges O
against O
her O

What O
happened O
? O

In O
the O
Scriptures O
, O
there O
are O
events O
that O
will O
happen O
after O
this O
: O

On O
the O
morning O
of O
February O
18 O
, O
2019 O
, O
in O
Dedugu B-LOC
, O
Fakala B-LOC
Rural I-LOC
Municipality I-LOC
, O
Jene B-LOC
Cercle I-LOC
, O
Umaru B-PER
Gajaga I-PER
went O
to O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
village O
to O
do O
some O
fishing O
. O

Along O
the O
way O
, O
he O
meets O
a O
young O
boy O
, O
13-year-old O
Nuhumu B-PER
Sidibe I-PER
, O
in O
his O
father O
's O
garden O
. O

After O
exchanging O
some O
difficult O
words O
, O
Umaru B-PER
Gajaga I-PER
painted O
several O
" O
" O
cupcups O
" O
" O
on O
Nuhumu B-PER
Sidibe I-PER
's O
body O
, O
especially O
on O
his O
arms O
, O
legs O
, O
and O
head O
. O

The O
woman O
's O
bleeding O
had O
stopped O
and O
she O
was O
naked O
in O
her O
place O
. O

And O
his O
brethren O
seized O
him O
, O
and O
his O
brethren O
, O
at O
the O
commandment O
of O
his O
father O
, O
and O
led O
him O
away O
, O
and O
brought O
him O
before O
the O
governor O
. O

After O
a O
thorough O
investigation O
by O
the O
local O
branch O
of O
the O
Gendarmerie B-ORG
, O
based O
in O
Jene B-LOC
, O
Umaru B-PER
Gajaga I-PER
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
. O

The O
accused O
was O
acquitted O
of O
the O
most O
serious O
charges O
against O
him O
. O

She O
explained O
that O
on O
February O
18 O
, O
2019 O
, O
she O
found O
a O
boy O
, O
Nuhumu B-PER
Sidibe I-PER
, O
in O
their O
garden O
and O
, O
as O
she O
recalled O
, O
began O
to O
tease O
him O
because O
he O
had O
no O
hair O
on O
his O
head O
. O

And O
in O
order O
to O
end O
his O
case O
, O
he O
approached O
Nuhum B-PER
Sidibe I-PER
and O
stabbed O
him O
several O
times O
with O
the O
knife O
he O
had O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

This O
emphasis O
- O
on O
God B-PER
- O
came O
to O
an O
end O
with O
the O
death O
of O
the O
late O
Nuhumu B-PER
Sidibe I-PER
at O
the O
hands O
of O
Umaru B-PER
Gajaga I-PER
. O

Umaru B-PER
replaced O
the O
older O
man O
. O

But O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
longhorns O
were O
white O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
case O
was O
interpreted O
to O
be O
murder O
within O
the O
meaning O
of O
articles O
199 O
and O
201 O
of O
the O
Penal O
Code O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
was O
found O
in O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
facts O
, O
that O
the O
charges O
against O
Umaru B-PER
Gajaga I-PER
, O
allegedly O
in O
Dedugu B-LOC
, O
Fakala B-LOC
rural O
municipality O
, O
in O
Jene B-LOC
kubeda I-LOC
, O
on O
February O
18 O
, O
2019 O
, O
he O
committed O
against O
him O
and O
caused O
the O
death O
of O
Nuhumu B-PER
Sidibe I-PER
, O
the O
offences O
are O
covered O
and O
punishable O
by O
article O
199 O
of O
the O
Penal O
Code O
. O

1 O
and O
201 O
. O

The O
accused O
subsequently O
confessed O
to O
the O
crimes O
for O
which O
he O
was O
convicted O
. O
In O
accordance O
with O
the O
rules O
of O
evidence O
, O
the O
accused O
's O
affidavit O
of O
imprisonment O
no O
. O
2 O
does O
not O
mention O
any O
penalty O
. O

The O
testimony O
about O
his O
physical O
body O
is O
good O
. O

But O
a O
psychiatrist O
, O
charged O
with O
running O
a O
psychiatric O
clinic O
, O
testified O
, O
as O
of O
11 O
December O
2019 O
, O
that O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
any O
physical O
or O
mental O
impairment O
that O
could O
have O
reduced O
the O
severity O
of O
his O
sentence O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
judges O
converted O
the O
high-profile O
case O
into O
a O
murder O
case O
by O
ruling O
that O
the O
allegations O
against O
the O
accused O

Umaru B-PER
Gajaga I-PER

he O
had O
no O

to O
appeal O

As O
a O

, O
Umaru B-PER
Gajaga I-PER

ask O

said O

the O

dismissed O

confirming O
that O

had O
all O

that O

Legu B-PER

were O
ignored O
by O

who O
agreed O
that O
Umaru B-PER

guilty O

sentenced O
him O

The O
special O

sent O

in O
which O
he O
scored O
seven O

he O
did O
not O
score O

With O
such O
a O
high O
level O
of O
evaluation O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
Italy B-LOC

the O
best O
chance O
of O
qualifying O
for O

To O
such O
an O

that O

In O
general O

not O

We O

However O
, O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
believe O
that O
the O

go O

such O

just O
to O

the O

ahead O
of O

four O

so O
that O

can O
conduct O

In O
a O
collaborative O
effort O

became O

about O

I O
have O
never O

have O
never O

ever O

on O
any O
of O
the O
allegations O

which O
are O
detailed O
in O
your O

, O
he O
wrote O
to O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
New B-ORG

Daily I-ORG
News I-ORG
page O
in O
no O
way O
discloses O
that O
President O
Ngugi B-PER
has O
made O
a O
formal O
request O
to O
visit O
the O
nuns O
in O
Mali B-LOC
. O

But O
just O
as O
he O
rewarded O
us O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
hand O
you O
over O
to O
investigators O
, O
beyond O
the O
curtain O
of O
time O
. O
All O
those O
who O
had O
served O
the O
Lord B-PER
conscientiously O
or O
were O
close O
to O
him O
had O
fallen O
from O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
conspirators O
. O

They O
have O
heard O
this O
story O
. O

And O
to O
add O
to O
that O
, O
there O
is O
no O
director O
who O
is O
equal O
to O
him O
except O
for O
the O
physical O
and O
moral O
perfection O
of O
the O
male O
and O
female O
basketball O
players O
, O
whose O
welfare O
he O
has O
always O
defended O
. O

What O
will O
happen O
to O
us O
? O

Why O
are O
Malians O
so O
hostile O
, O
to O
the O
point O
of O
trying O
to O
justify O
their O
own O
peace O
in O
front O
of O
the O
world O
? O
Our O
young O
colleague O
Kasimu B-PER
Tarawore I-PER
asked O
himself O
on O
his O
Facebook O
page O
. O

And O
to O
remind O
you O
that O
this O
event O
is O
organized O
and O
organized O
here O
in O
Bamako B-LOC
. O

They O
think O
they O
are O
embarrassing O
the O
Lord B-PER
, O
but O
after O
him O
, O
Mary B-PER
is O
embarrassed O
again O
. O

We O
should O
be O
proud O
of O
the O
Africans O
in O
FIBA B-ORG
, O
especially O
the O
Malians O
. O

The O
penalty O
is O
unforgiveness O
, O
which O
has O
, O
in O
some O
instances O
, O
failed O
, O
and O
underground O
mines O
have O
been O
built O
to O
defile O
it O
. O

And O
though O
in O
danger O
of O
ruining O
the O
country O
, O
he O
did O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
repent O
of O
their O
wickedness O
. O

This O
is O
not O
necessarily O
a O
bad O
thing O
, O
because O
no O
one O
is O
able O
to O
do O
a O
good O
job O
of O
promoting O
democracy O
, O
equality O
, O
and O
African O
integration O
today O
. O

And O
to O
capture O
the O
evil O
Prince O
Haman B-PER
to O
such O
an O
extent O
. O

And O
as O
a O
well-known O
proverb O
says O
, O
there O
is O
a O
judge O
who O
calls O
the O
time O
, O
and O
he O
puts O
everyone O
in O
his O
place O

Loran B-PER

for O

His O
refusal O
to O

out O
of O

to O
visit O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC

its O

28 O

at O
the O
National B-ORG

Male I-PER
. O

The O
expedition O
, O
led O
by O
Mmu B-PER
Sanogo I-PER
and O
his O
colleagues O
, O
was O
the O
first O
expedition O
to O
cross O
the O

two O

, O
which O
led O
to O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
of I-LOC
Mali I-LOC
. O

We O
first O
chose O
him O
to O
come O
to O
the O
National O
Football O
League O
, O

Minister O
Ikasa B-PER
said O
this O
because O
it O
is O
an O
independent O
body O
, O
which O
is O
a O
representative O
body O
, O
a O
forum O
for O
dialogue O
between O
the O
National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
and O
the O
citizens O
. O

Who O
, O
more O
than O
that O
weakling O
, O
can O
tell O
the O
basic O
nature O
of O
the O
state O
, O
what O
citizens O
think O
of O
power O
, O
the O
power O
that O
must O
be O
reinterpreted O
, O
reorganized O
, O
he O
says O
. O

Today O
. O

With O
the O
independence O
of O
the O
nation O
, O
as O
emphasized O
by O
the O
great O
scholar O
Ibarahima B-PER
Ikasa I-PER
Mayiga I-PER
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
build O
a O
nation O
. O

According O
to O
him O
, O
understanding O
is O
the O
key O
to O
understanding O
situations O
and O
considering O
how O
best O
to O
handle O
them O
. O

So O
, O
we O
made O
a O
good O
pitch O
, O
and O
the O
Minister O
went O
through O
with O
the O
speech O
. O

We O
have O
examined O
the O
disorders O
of O
the O
behavior O
of O
large O
public O
institutions O
. O

An O
examination O
of O
the O
dynamics O
of O
events O
, O
power O
and O
society O
, O
across O
political O
boundaries O
and O
between O
private O
citizens O
. O

Diseases O
caused O
by O
adverse O
events O
have O
been O
studied O
. O

In O
such O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
, O
Minister O
Ibarahima B-PER
Ikasa I-PER
Mayiga I-PER
recalled O
, O
we O
had O
come O
in O
a O
dream O
, O
as O
the O
visit O
turned O
into O
a O
moment O
of O
celebration O
, O
to O
commemorate O
the O
image O
of O
our O
country O
from O
its O
constitution O
to O
its O
citizenship O
, O
on O
the O
process O
of O
corruption O
, O
to O
reorganize O
the O
citizenship O
in O
this O
way O
, O
so O
that O
it O
can O
be O
preserved O
. O

be O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
country O
, O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
. O

This O
is O
our O
old O
way O
. O

We O
actually O
have O
a O
classroom O
. O

We O
are O
listening O
to O
the O
story O
of O
a O
public O
servant O
who O
has O
stood O
up O
to O
lawbreakers O
, O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
of O
his O
life O
, O
lawbreakers O
of O
the O
state O
as O
well O
as O
lawbreakers O
of O
the O
North B-LOC
, O
I O
am O
talking O
about O
the O
SEDEYAWO B-ORG
here O
, O
but O
who O
has O
also O
gone O
through O
all O
the O
high O
levels O
of O
government O
to O
watch O
. O

, O
to O
understand O
, O
to O
analyze O
. O

That O
's O
what O
we O
tasted O
today O
. O

This O
is O
not O
an O
afterthought O
. O

We O
will O
return O
shortly O
to O
a O
more O
detailed O
analysis O
of O
the O
negotiations O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
individual O
conferences O
, O
the O
National B-ORG
Consultative I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
, O
which O
itself O
was O
under O
the O
auspices O
of O
the O
National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
subsequent O
National B-ORG
Dialogue I-ORG
, O
whose O
final O
session O
was O
held O
in O
the O
country O
. O

The O
pace O
slowed O
down O
. O

The O
debates O
on O
the O
defense O
of O
the O
centre O
, O
the O
other O
assemblies O
and O
the O
day O
of O
statehood O
, O
democracy O
, O
education O
, O
justice O
, O
advocacy O
( O
and O
so O
on O
) O
. O
, O
are O
examples O
, O
but O
until O
we O
get O
to O
the O
real O
choices O
and O
the O
building O
of O
a O
new O
Mali B-LOC
. O

That O
's O
what O
we O
found O
yesterday O
. O

We O
saw O
what O
could O
happen O
. O

How O
, O
in O
the O
shortest O
possible O
time O
, O
to O
achieve O
all O
this O
, O
to O
find O
solutions O
that O
are O
ready O
to O
be O
used O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
central O
defense O
and O
later O
by O
the O
new O
powers O
, O
which O
will O
be O
put O
to O
the O
test O
by O
the O
drafting O
of O
solutions O
that O
have O
been O
agreed O
upon O
, O
accepted O
by O
all O
Malians O
. O

We O
have O
included O
these O
as O
possible O
solutions O
for O
Mali B-LOC

And O
we O
were O
very O
worried O
about O
our O
chances O
. O

I O
thank O
the O
National B-ORG
Broadcasting I-ORG
Company I-ORG
and O
its O
staff O
for O
their O
enthusiasm O
. O

We O
will O
reach O
out O
to O
all O
Malians O
so O
that O
everyone O
understands O
that O
there O
is O
a O
need O
, O
a O
mutual O
encouragement O
in O
Mali B-LOC

, O
which O
has O
resulted O
in O
the O

. O

Because O
of O
his O
words O
, O

These O
meeting O

should O
be O
primarily O
driven O
by O
the O

The O
town O

Kidali B-LOC

in O
eastern O
Mali B-LOC
, O
has O
been O
the O
site O
of O
a O
bloody O
presidential O
election O
in O
recent O
weeks O
. O

After O
a O
series O
of O
ministerial O
visits O
, O
it O
was O
finally O
up O
to O
the O
Algerian O
Convention B-ORG
Supervisory I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
to O
meet O
in O
its O
constituency O
, O
which O
had O
been O
cut O
off O
from O
government O
representation O
for O
at O
least O
seven O
years O
. O

We O
have O
come O
a O
long O
way O
since O
the O
death O
of O
Prime O
Minister O
Musa B-PER
Mara I-PER
in O
2014 O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
negotiations O
have O
continued O
between O
the O
mountain O
militias O
, O
controlled O
by O
the O
city O
council O
, O
and O
the O
National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
. O

Over O
the O
years O
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
decline O
in O
militancy O
following O
the O
division O
of O
the O
country O
, O
particularly O
in O
Mali B-LOC
. O

The O
inhabitants O
themselves O
are O
tired O
of O
living O
in O
isolation O
, O
while O
the O
bakers O
of O
the O
world O
know O
that O
the O
slaves O
of O
the O
sahelikungo O
are O
warriors O
, O
who O
have O
no O
way O
out O
of O
this O
vast O
plain O
of O
separation O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
, O
ethnic O
divisions O
between O
the O
Ifogai O
and O
the O
Imegadi O
became O
more O
pronounced O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
Ghasia B-PER
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
the O
city O
by O
force O
, O
but O
Elijah B-PER
Gamu I-PER
and O
his O
men O
are O
allowed O
to O
roam O
the O
city O
. O

Many O
escaped O
from O
terrorist O
attacks O
, O
and O
the O
revolts O
of O
women O
and O
children O
, O
which O
were O
led O
by O
the O
gunmen O
of O
the O
volcano O
, O
are O
almost O
over O
. O

Kidali B-PER
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
remained O
like O
a O
hostile O
woman O
, O
hoping O
for O
a O
reward O
in O
exchange O
for O
her O
beautiful O
body O
. O

In O
June O
, O
he O
threatened O
the O
applicants O
with O
a O
petition O
, O
which O
called O
for O
the O
establishment O
of O
two O
military O
bases O
in O
Guruma B-LOC
by O
the O
Confederation B-ORG
of I-ORG
Malayalees I-ORG
( O
SeMA B-ORG

. O

Staying O
away O
from O
violence O
is O
an O
act O
of O
generosity O
, O
according O
to O
SeMA B-ORG
officials O
, O
who O
do O
so O
out O
of O
love O
for O
the O
civilians O
who O
are O
being O
targeted O
by O
the O
violence O
. O

But O
the O
SeMA B-ORG
's O
plans O
to O
seize O
the O
territories O
have O
not O
been O
welcomed O
by O
many O
Malians O
, O
especially O
in O
some O
of O
the O
eastern O
provinces O
. O

Half O
of O
all O
the O
people O
who O
come O
from O
the O
northeastern O
provinces O
do O
not O
speak O
the O
language O
of O
a O
mountain O
warrior O
, O
who O
survives O
by O
fleeing O
Kidal B-LOC
to O
bring O
bricks O
to O
Guruma B-LOC
, O
who O
is O
suffering O
from O
insecurity O
. O

The O
decision O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O
Ifogaz B-LOC
community O
and O
move O
elsewhere O
is O
a O
military O
decision O
, O
which O
is O
unfavorable O
to O
the O
government O
, O
which O
has O
softened O
its O
stance O
, O
allowing O
it O
to O
understand O
that O
the O
SeMA B-ORG
has O
acted O
alone O
in O
this O
matter O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
there O
has O
been O
some O
encouragement O
in O
recent O
months O
, O
if O
not O
since O
2020 O
, O
when O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
Western O
powers O
ratified O
the O
Algiers O
Accord O
for O
Reconciliation O
and O
Reconciliation O
in O
Mali B-LOC
, O
a O
partial O
peace O
process O
. O

During O
the O
all-party O
talks O
in O
Bamako B-LOC
in O
December O
2019 O
, O
the O
envoys O
of O
Kidali B-ORG
were O
accused O
of O
illegally O
entering O
Mali B-LOC

One O
of O
these O
critics O
, O
Moses B-PER
Agi I-PER
Ataher I-PER
, O
is O
the O
current O
Minister O
of O
Children B-ORG

. O

Many O
other O
people O
from O
the O
town O
of O
Kidali B-LOC
are O
in O
the O
government O
, O
such O
as O
Alahamudu B-PER
Agi I-PER
Ilyeni I-PER
, O
a O
Malian-based O
foreign O
minister O

The O
former O

, O
according O
to O
ATeTe B-ORG
, O
is O
not O
unknown O
in O

If O
the O
ministers O
and O
ambassadors O
of O
the O
country O
take O
the O
path O
of O
Kidali B-PER
again O
, O
it O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
because O
it O
is O
the O
opening O
of O
these O
doors O
of O
the O

to O
the O
indigenous O
peoples O

who O
have O
remained O

not O

why O
they O

This O
was O
the O

in O
2020 O
with O
some O
Islamist O
leaders O
and O
the O
less-than-successful O
appearances O
of O
MUSENKI-EREFIPE B-PER

They O
increased O

In O
accepting O
Sogel B-PER

did O
Colonel O
Asimi B-PER

forget O
that O
the O

We O
say O
to O

that O
there O
is O
a O
great O
difference O
between O

that O
of O

which O
is O

The O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
understand O
that O
his O
goal O
was O
not O
to O

Mali B-LOC

to O
translate O
his O

He O
will O
have O
everything O

him O

said O

it O

it O

The O
manner O
in O
which O
this O
is O
done O

not O
matter O

is O
preferable O

one O

those O
things O

no O

This O
new O

carries O
the O
risk O
of O
an O
open O
contract O
for O
further O
negotiations O

which O
would O
not O

result O

The O
failure O
of O

capture O
Kidali B-LOC
was O
the O
culmination O
of O
a O
long O
campaign O

which O
ended O
in O
failure O

The O

who O
show O
their O
contempt O

the O

Consequently O

there O

challenges O
of O
his O
schooling O

relying O
on O
his O

skills O

obtaining O

the O

that O

Since O
his O
father O
's O
stroke O
two O
years O
ago O
, O
he O
has O
not O
returned O
to O
work O
. O

During O
her O
childhood O
, O
her O
mother-in-law O
, O
Elodi B-PER
Geliye I-PER
, O
became O
disillusioned O
with O
the O
role O
of O
journalists O
. O

It O
's O
been O
forty-eight O
hours O
, O
and O
hell O
is O
round O
. O

Then O
they O
took O
him O
and O
brought O
him O
before O
the O
Sanhedrin B-ORG
to O
be O
punished O
. O

His O
intention O
was O
to O
have O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
president O
. O

She O
( O
the O
mother-in-law O
) O
added O
this O
, O
while O
acknowledging O
that O
the O
wedding O
ceremony O
was O
especially O
inappropriate O
for O
an O
ordinary O
person O
, O

Who O
has O
never O
beaten O
anyone O
. O

I O
think O
she O
understands O
her O
wrongdoing O
. O

If O
we O
stay O
true O
to O
the O
facts O
, O
I O
only O
listened O
to O
Emmanuel B-PER
Macron I-PER
, O
because O
the O
conscience O
of O
injustice O
escaped O
my O
body O
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
I O
have O
fought O
on O
the O
road O
or O
in O
my O
personal O
endeavors O
. O

And O
he O
answered O
. O

Damien B-PER
Tarel I-PER
has O
confirmed O
that O
he O
belongs O
to O
the O
far O
right O
of O
the O
political O
spectrum O
. O

In O
his O
words O
, O

Corn O
represents O
the O
corruption O
of O
our O
country O
. O

he O
took O
it O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
. O

He O
was O
deeply O
saddened O
by O
the O
events O
of O
the O
second O
great O
epoch O
of O
human O
history O
and O
paid O
tribute O
to O
the O
people O
once O
again O
. O

Before O
the O
Revolution O
, O
people O
did O
not O
like O
to O
lie O
. O

He O
was O
nicknamed O
" O
" O
" O
Montezuo B-PER
" O
" O
, O
" O
" O
" O
Sandy B-PER
" O
" O
" O
, O

he O
explains O
it O
this O
way O
. O

This O
is O
primarily O
due O
to O
the O
rivalry O
between O
rival O
gangs O
, O
which O
is O
a O
form O
of O
corruption O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
first O
constraint O
is O
the O
voice O
. O

I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
if O
I O
had O
called O
Emmanuel B-PER
Macron I-PER
at O
the O
dawn O
of O
the O
sword-wielding O
man O
, O
he O
would O
have O
answered O
me O
. O

If O
Montezuma B-PER
wants O
us O
to O
go O
, O
he O
will O
. O

Macron B-PER
refers O
to O
Emmanuel B-PER
Macron I-PER
's O
policies O
in O
the O
country O
. O

To O
commemorate O
, O
the O
man O
sang O
: O
" O
" O
" O
" O
" O
Crush O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
" O
" O
" O
" O

During O
demographic O
transition O
. O

Emmanuel B-PER
Macron I-PER
, O
who O
was O
not O
openly O
critical O
, O
responded O
to O
a O
question-and-answer O
session O
at O
the O
same O
time O
on O
BEEFEYEMUTEV B-ORG
. O

The O
governor O
reiterated O
the O
action O
, O
limiting O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
action O
. O

Thus O
, O
Elise B-PER
Luwanse I-PER
believes O
that O
the O
country O
is O
not O
in O
a O
bad O
place O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
New O

, O
and O
instead O
focuses O
on O
the O
positive O
side O
of O
things O
as O
she O
sees O
it O
in O
France B-LOC
. O

Let O
's O
not O
dwell O
too O
much O
on O
this O
silly O
gesture O
and O
who O
is O
to O
blame O
[ O
for O
the O
slap O
in O
the O
face O
] O
, O
more O
on O
what O
he O
is O
saying O
. O

According O
to O
him O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
possible O
and O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
nothing O
is O
done O
[ O
... O
] O
it O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
to O
get O
a O
slap O
on O
the O
wrist O
when O
going O
out O
in O
public O
. O

Emmanuel B-PER
Macron I-PER
refused O
to O
comment O
on O
the O
perpetrator O
's O
speedy O
trial O
, O
for O
example O
. O

President O
of O
the O
Republic O
, O

This O
is O
not O
a O
genuine O
sin O
. O

But O
the O
real O
one O
is O
the O
one O
that O
applies O
to O
wives O
, O
if O
they O
die O
in O
their O
husbands O
' O
blows O
. O

For O
we O
are O
fighting O
a O
great O
battle O
against O
those O
who O
are O
stronger O
than O

are O

the O

It O

As O
a O
reminder O
, O
Minister O
Abudulayi B-PER

emphasized O
that O
not O
a O

, O
but O
that O
all O

Therefore O
, O
according O
to O
Lieutenant-Colonel O

Mayiga I-PER
, O
the O
Prime O
Minister O

and O
resolve O
disputes O
between O
the O
two O
entities O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Minister O
Mayiga B-PER
added O
, O
it O
was O
necessary O
for O
my O
cabinet O
to O
seek O
the O
advice O
of O

parties O
and O
NGOs O
on O
the O
matter O
. O

The O

In O

during O
the O
two O
days O
of O
work O
, O
Abudulayi B-PER
Mayiga I-PER
announced O
that O
there O
would O
be O
four O
demonstrations O
. O

The O
first O
refers O
to O
the O
historical O
existence O
of O
at O
least O
one O
regulatory O
agency O
( O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Culture I-ORG

. O

The O
second O
focuses O
on O
the O
historical O
record O
, O
focusing O
on O
the O
preparation O
of O

during O
the O
period O
of O

in O
Mali B-LOC
( O
referred O
to O

. O

The O
third O
concerns O

with O
responsibilities O
and O
commitments O
to O

for O

by O
a O
single O
crisis O
management O
agency O
, O
the O

. O

Finally O
, O
the O
fourth O
focuses O
on O
the O
feasibility O
, O
necessity O
, O
feasibility O
and O
timeliness O
of O
establishing O
one O
or O
more O
disaster O
management O
agencies O
to O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
Minister O

Mayiga I-PER
said O
he O
believes O
that O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O

will O
resolve O
the O
crisis O
in O
the O
country O
. O

I O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
avoid O
congratulating O
all O

for O
the O

those O
who O

The O
accusations O
against O
President O
Habib B-PER
Sissoko I-PER
resurfaced O
on O
Sunday O
, O
with O
the O
Senegalese O
newspaper O

making O
its O
first O
appearance O
on O
the O
cover O
of O
the O
" O

cartoon O
. O

There O
was O
a O
time O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
when O
people O
would O
talk O
about O
this O
goat O
, O
and O
when O
he O
did O
, O
he O
would O
think O
to O
himself O
that O
if O
he O
had O
such O
wealth O
, O
people O
would O
talk O
about O
him O
in O
a O
different O
way O

In O

an O
empty O

was O
assembled O
at O

In O
terms O
of O
content O
as O
well O
as O
structure O
, O
it O
was O
created O
to O
spread O
lies O
in O
order O
to O
discredit O
President O
Habib B-PER
Sissoko I-PER
. O

He O
" O
" O
" O
questioned O
people O
who O
did O
not O
want O
to O
see O
this O
great O
and O
humble O
architect O
, O
who O
made O
the O
concept O
of O
the O
" O
" O
star O
of O
Mali B-LOC
in O
sports O
" O
" O
and O
the O
" O
" O
zezolenpics O
" O
" O
self-evident O
. O

We O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
interfere O
with O
the O
investigation O
, O
which O
has O
been O
opened O
in O
Dakar B-LOC
( O
Senegal B-LOC
) O
, O
but O
we O
can O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
demonstrate O
that O
this O
allegation O
is O
based O
on O
a O
false O
premise O
, O
namely O
that O
Habib B-PER
's O
illness O
affects O
some O
children O
, O
who O
are O
beaten O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

These O
same O
people O
, O
who O
do O
not O
have O
sheep O
, O
would O
have O
done O
everything O
to O
remove O
him O
from O
his O
position O
in O
Mali B-LOC
with O
dignity O
and O
prestige O
. O

Humble O
and O
unassuming O
, O
Habib B-PER
never O
defended O
himself O
. O

But O
avoid O
foolish O
babbling O
and O
godless O
chatter O
, O
because O
those O
who O
indulge O
in O
it O
will O
be O
destroyed O
by O
their O
own O
ungodliness O
. O

He O
constantly O
allowed O
time O
to O
pass O
, O
meaning O
that O
he O
was O
confident O
that O
if O
he O
saw O
them O
being O
treated O
unjustly O
to O
this O
degree O
, O
they O
would O
not O
be O
wise O
and O
would O
not O
give O
up O
on O
the O
blessing O
of O
this O
heavenly O
inheritance O
. O

As O
he O
appropriates O
this O
phrase O
, O
it O
serves O
as O
a O
reminder O
that O
a O
" O
" O
" O
" O
man O
" O
" O
is O
a O
sentient O
being O
who O
seeks O
to O
harm O
others O
. O

Violence O
has O
never O
brought O
peace O
to O
anyone O
. O
" O
" O
" O
" O

And O
what O
is O
not O
so O
sinful O
is O
that O
the O
president O
of O
the O
SENOSIME B-ORG
has O
never O
tried O
to O
impose O
happiness O
, O
even O
though O
he O
has O
created O
a O
path O
for O
himself O
, O
unique O
and O
eye-catching O
with O
a O
heart O
full O
of O
knowledge O
of O
our O
leadership O
, O
which O
is O
in O
his O
blood O
. O

In O
our O
opinion O
, O
it O
is O
not O
the O
role O
of O
Habib B-PER
Sissoko I-PER
and O
Hamani B-PER
Njangi I-PER
to O
defend O
themselves O
, O
but O
it O
is O
the O
role O
of O
Mali B-LOC
and O
the O
international O
community O
to O
mobilize O
against O
it O
. O

And O
not O
only O
because O
the O
two O
leaders O
of O
this O
terrorist O
group O
are O
representatives O
of O
the O
state O
, O
but O
also O
because O
we O
have O
all O
the O
evidence O
to O
accuse O
us O
of O
this O
treason O
, O
those O
behind O
them O
are O
not O
children O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
some O
states O
or O
authorities O
have O
conspired O
against O
him O
, O
rather O
than O
our O
nation O
's O
uprising O
from O
its O
foundation O
in O
some O
other O
way O
, O
which O
has O
preserved O
its O
reputation O
, O
which O
is O
, O
therefore O
, O
a O
good O
excuse O
so O
far O
. O

Our O
International B-ORG
Court I-ORG
of I-ORG
Justice I-ORG
must O
provide O
a O
genuine O
response O
to O
the O
threat O
of O
terrorism O
, O
and O
the O
atrocities O
committed O
by O
athletes O
in O
international O

events O
are O
not O
hidden O
from O
anyone O
in O
the O
world O
. O

International O
competition O
that O
destroys O

goods O
. O
- O
Thus O
, O
since O
the O
revival O
of O
the O
modern O
Olympic O
Games O
in O
the O
late O
19th O
century O
under O
Baron O
Peter B-PER
de I-PER
Coubertin I-PER
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
steady O
increase O
in O
the O
role O
of O
sport O
in O
politics O
and O

in O
international O
affairs O
. O

Thus O
, O
God B-PER
forgave O
Nelson B-PER

( O
July O

, O
1918 O
- O
December O

" O
" O
Physical O
activity O
has O
become O
both O
a O
source O
of O
light O
and O
an O
adjective O
, O
meaning O
a O
substitute O
for O
it O
. O

Athletes O
actually O
represent O
their O
countries O
more O
often O
than O
any O
other O
celebrity O
, O
if O
not O
more O
so O
than O
their O
own O
country O
. O

One O
thinks O
of O
Iseni B-PER
Bolt I-PER
, O
of O
Jamaica B-LOC
, O
or O
Nowaki B-PER
Jokowi I-PER
, O
of O
Serbia B-LOC
, O
a O
" O
great O
" O
scholar O
of O
international O
relations O
who O
recently O
gave O
us O
this O
insight O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
understand O
why O
the O
great O
powers O
are O
at O
war O
today O
, O
since O
they O
have O
created O
for O
themselves O
the O
means O
of O
" O
international O
" O
diplomacy O
. O

This O
is O
because O
the O
" O
" O
" O
sport O
" O
" O
is O
essentially O
an O
international O
competition O
in O
which O
emerging O
nations O
compete O
for O
supremacy O
. O

Trying O
to O
become O
a O
great O
sporting O
nation O
, O
as O
our O
leaders O
say O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
it O
is O
hoped O
that O
politics O
, O
international O
affairs O
, O
culture O
, O
science O
will O
be O
forgotten O
. O

and O
economics O
. O

Currently O
, O
sport O
accounts O
for O
about O
2 O
% O
of O
the O
world O
's O
gross O
domestic O
product O
( O
GDP O
) O
, O
with O
an O
estimated O
value O
of O
€ O
600 O
billion O
. O

For O
nearly O
two O
decades O
, O
sport O
has O
been O
an O
integral O
part O
of O
Mali B-LOC
's O
identity O
as O
an O
instrument O
of O
national O
self-determination O
that O
can O
enhance O
the O
country O
's O
prestige O
in O
the O
international O
arena O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
we O
need O
to O
reassess O
the O
politics O
of O
Mali B-LOC
's O
representation O
in O
international O
sports O
bodies O
, O
especially O
in O
decision-making O
roles O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
everything O
is O
being O
done O
today O
to O
corrupt O
the O
reputation O
of O
Mali B-LOC
in O
some O
institutions O
, O
taking O
the O
risk O
of O
shutting O
others O
down O
completely O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
our O
fellow O
citizens O
as O
well O
as O
foreigners O
have O
not O
spoken O
highly O
of O
him O
as O
they O
ought O
to O
. O

If O
we O
really O
want O
to O
be O
a O
great O
sporting O
nation O
one O
day O
, O
we O
cannot O
continue O
to O
ignore O
our O
fellow O
citizens O
, O
who O
have O
fought O
to O
climb O
to O
the O
top O
of O
African O
and O
world O
sporting O
institutions O
, O
by O
celebrating O
their O
freedom O
and O
independence O
. O

He O
is O
a O
hypocrite O
and O
an O
evil O
person O
. O

For O
those O
who O
know O
this O
man O
, O
with O
such O
a O
rare O
leadership O
and O
a O
great O
sense O
of O
humour O
, O
to O
accuse O
Habib B-PER
Sissoko I-PER
of O
financial O
misconduct O
is O
laughable O
, O
considering O
that O
he O
is O
willing O
to O
lift O
his O
own O
finger O
to O
support O
sports O
, O
first O
of O
all O
zido O
. O

During O
and O
after O
the O
Summer O
Olympics O
, O
athletes O
of O
all O
abilities O
are O
encouraged O
to O
showcase O
their O
talents O
. O

But O
just O
as O
he O
never O
ceases O
to O
repeat O
it O
to O
his O
faithful O
ones O
, O
it O
always O
belongs O
to O
God B-PER
, O
and O
to O
Time B-PER
. O

There O
is O
a O
deceitful O
pride O
in O
the O
one O
who O
thinks O
he O
is O
something O
when O
in O
fact O
he O
is O
nothing O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
does O
not O
say O
, O
" O
" O
" O
" O
we O
can O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
anything O
happens O

But O
one O
thing O
is O

is O

In O

The O

is O
so O
full O
of O

that O
this O

Following O
his O

he O
allowed O

many O

Today O
, O
he O
has O
acquired O
an O
understanding O
of O
people O
and O
life O
through O
football O

During O
his O
presidency O
, O
he O
was O
accused O

the O

events O
, O
his O
actions O
and O
those O
of O
everyone O

However O
, O
the O
main O
characters O
of O

portrayed O

unprincipled O

It O

directed O

the O

However O
, O
the O
term O

contract O
expired O
at O
the O
end O

The O
directors O

the O

, O
who O
had O
been O
committed O
to O
performing O
in O
Mali B-LOC
for O
several O
years O

took O
up O
the O
role O
quickly O

received O
a O
high-profile O
endorsement O

the O
French O

At O

the O

Ibrahim B-PER
Bubakari I-PER
Keyita I-PER

at O

He O
did O
not O
elaborate O

it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
consider O
the O
book O

good O
intentions O

he O
told O
Mali B-LOC

president O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
not O
unique O
to O
IBEKA B-ORG
, O
in O
particular O
. O

This O
was O
partially O
reversed O
, O
however O
, O
when O
the O
bill O
was O
rushed O
through O
the O
House B-ORG
of I-ORG
Commons I-ORG
, O
this O
time O
by O
the O
Minister O
of O
Defence B-ORG
, O
Zan-Ivi B-PER
Lediriyan I-PER
, O
and O
did O
so O
, O
according O
to O
our O
correspondents O
, O
several O
times O
in O
2014 O
. O

He O
was O
so O
critical O
of O
Ledrian B-PER
that O
he O
predicted O
a O
French O
military O
uprising O
against O
his O
allies O
, O
explaining O
that O
soldiers O
from O
both O
countries O
were O
dying O
at O
the O
same O
time O
on O
the O
battlefield O
. O

It O
was O
through O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
that O
he O
sought O
the O
support O
of O
French O
entrepreneurs O
, O
but O
never O
in O
this O
way O
. O

So O
people O
asked O
questions O
about O
them O
. O

The O
president O
had O
nothing O
against O
Canadians O
, O
and O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
persuaded O
to O
change O
it O
, O
one O
of O
IBEKA B-ORG

business O
associates O
said O
. O

But O
between O
Paris B-LOC
and O
Bamako B-LOC
in O
the O
process O
, O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
no O
end O
in O
sight O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O
president O
agreed O
, O
and O
our O
correspondent O
nodded O
his O
head O
. O

Overwhelmed O
by O
his O
unwillingness O
to O
negotiate O
, O
Ottawa B-LOC
tried O
to O
hang O
on O

his O
property O
. O

His O
representative O
in O
Bamako B-LOC
, O
Liwi B-PER

Lorimiye I-PER

expressed O
concern O
about O
the O
two-time O
Lebanese O
prime O
minister O
Sada B-PER
Samake I-PER
, O
who O
was O
ousted O
today O
. O

It O
was O
rejected O
so O
that O
no O
root O
system O
could O
be O
restored O
to O
its O
original O
form O
. O

Nothing O
could O
stop O
him O
. O

The O
Malian O
authorities O
have O
been O
accused O
of O
ignoring O
my O
concerns O
, O
a O
foreign O

official O
said O
. O

According O
to O
a O
former O
member O
of O
the O
French B-ORG
Théâtre B-ORG

Thalès I-ORG
( O
the O
father O
of O

he O
also O
prepared O
the O

play O
a O
role O

it O

as O
he O
quickly O
recovered O
: O
people O
informed O
us O
that O
his O

been O
completely O
suppressed O

our O

explained O

with O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
cost O
( O
estimated O
to O
be O
about O
3 O
% O
of O
the O
total O
cost O
in O
Tarsus B-LOC

the O
time O
) O
was O
also O
exorbitant O
. O

A O
collaboration O
agreement O
was O
finally O
signed O
in O
January O
2015 O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
agreement O
with O
the O
Bank B-ORG

since O
then O
only O
the O
United B-LOC

sells O
passports O

while O
Mali B-LOC
does O
not O
. O

The O
passports O
issued O
by O
the O
French O
were O
of O
good O
quality O
, O
as O
they O
were O
very O
difficult O
to O
pronounce O

It O
was O
published O
in O

suggested O
an O
alternative O

interest O

the O

to O
reveal O

the O
nature O
of O

I O
mean O
, O
if O
there O

a O

, O
what O
hope O
can O
one O
have O
for O
these O

Children O
, O
can O
we O
have O
confidence O
in O
future O
generations O
when O
they O
indulge O
in O
such O
vices O
as O
drunkenness O
and O
gluttony O
? O

Certainly O
not O
! O
The O
Creator O
threw O
it O
into O
the O
wind O
and O
it O
became O
a O
whirlwind O
. O

He O
went O
on O
to O
argue O
that O
hangings O
do O
no O
good O
and O
that O
this O
relocation O
was O
in O
complete O
violation O
of O
the O
laws O
of O
the O
land O
and O
the O
duty O
of O
public O
safety O
. O

No O
one O
ever O
touches O
the O
hanging O
, O
and O
no O
one O
has O
ever O
seen O
a O
hanging O
like O
it O
. O

This O
decision O
marked O
the O
end O
of O
our O
departure O
, O
and O
if O
he O
( O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
cloak O
) O
did O
not O
cover O
it O
, O
we O
would O
stand O
in O
our O
position O
and O
lose O
our O
temper O
, O
he O
did O
so O
as O
a O
warning O
. O

On O
behalf O
of O
the O
prophets O
of O
Kabbalah O
, O
scholar O
Isaac B-PER
Bacili I-PER
emphasized O
that O
such O
a O
state O
of O
affairs O
is O
not O
acceptable O
in O
a O
Muslim-majority O
country O
. O

The O
children O
's O
struggle O
for O
survival O
, O
in O
other O
words O
, O
depends O
on O
the O
good O
behaviour O
of O
the O
children O
. O

It O
is O
an O
unclean O
garment O
, O
written O
in O

and O
known O
throughout O
the O
world O
. O

We O
( O
Kabalah O

pointed O
out O
. O

In O
response O
to O
the O
Cabal O

crackdown O
on O
gang-related O
hangings O
, O
the O
president O
, O
Suleimani B-PER
Berehima I-PER
Kamisoko I-PER
, O
stated O
in O
a O
statement O
that O
no O
one O
will O
be O
held O
accountable O
for O
the O
Cabal O

actions O
and O
that O
no O
one O

the O
consequences O
of O
such O
hangings O
, O
including O
kidnappings O
, O
murders O
, O
and O
torture O
. O

other O
difficulties O
. O

If O
we O
don O
't O
fight O
to O
close O
this O
tent O
, O
we O
'll O
never O
have O
peace O
. O

It O
has O
a O
serious O
impact O
on O
the O
well-being O
of O
our O
children O
, O
brothers O

He O
said O
that O
it O
was O
too O
late O
for O

to O
get O
up O
and O
stand O
by O
this O
man O
( O
the O

) O
, O
and O
Kamisoko B-PER

this O

In O

like O

According O

exacerbating O
the O

based O
on O

with O
the O
consequence O
that O
the O

will O
receive O
less O

the O

it O

I O
appeal O
to O
the O
public O
to O
keep O
us O
informed O
so O
that O

the O

dropped O

And O
I O
think O
the O
answer O
to O
this O
can O
be O
found O
in O
the O
field O
of O
psychology O
. O

We O
are O
very O
pleased O
and O
excited O
about O
this O
partnership O

which O
has O
encouraged O

encourages O
us O
to O
do O

not O

Today O

the O

that O
no O

find O

encourages O

out O

many O

have O
pulled O
out O

Today O

moved O

settled O

a O
result O
of O
